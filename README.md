# GLOW Glowing arches prototype

## Introduction
This repository contains the prototype for the "Glowing arches" concept. This concept involves creating a space where visitors walk through arches (or some other construction) on which spotlights are placed. These spotlights will track visitors, or groups of visitors walking close together with a certain color which will be interchanged with other people when they cross them. This specific interaction is subject to change upon further user testing.

## Setup
The setup requires the LED TMH-9 Moving Head Wash spotlight, an arduino with DMX shield, camera/webcam, and finally Python on your computer.
